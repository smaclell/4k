This is a simple service for retrieving/interacting with the [4k world map data](http://4kworldmap.com/). The data exclusively belongs to 4k world map project.

# Get started

You must have Docker installed. If you are using Docker for Mac, make sure to share the repo directory.

Please also install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Our map files are large enough to have trouble fitting in a normal repo.

To develop the application run `./start.dev`

# Managing the Data

To simplify the data before publishing we import and restructure it from the individual regions and maps to flat files. Update the individual files unders `maps` and then run either of the following:

```
node ./data/map.importer.js
node ./data/region.importer.js
```
